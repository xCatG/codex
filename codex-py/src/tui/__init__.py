# This file makes Python treat the 'tui' directory as a package.
# It can be empty.

# You could put package-level imports here if desired, e.g.:
# from .app import CodexTerminalApp

# Or define __all__ to specify what gets imported with 'from codex_py.src.tui import *'
# __all__ = ["app", "screens"]
