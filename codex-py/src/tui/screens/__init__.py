# This file makes Python treat the 'screens' directory as a package.
# It can be empty.

# You could put package-level imports here if desired, e.g.:
# from .chat_screen import ChatScreen

# Or define __all__ to specify what gets imported with 'from codex_py.src.tui.screens import *'
# __all__ = ["chat_screen"]
